                            unique opportunity to witness one of the largest wild Asian elephant gatherings in the world. In addition to elephants,
                            Minneriya is home to leopards, deer, and a variety of bird species. Its diverse habitats of forests, grasslands, and
                            wetlands make it a haven for wildlife enthusiasts.</p>
